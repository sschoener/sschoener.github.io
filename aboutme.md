![A picture of me. You are missing out.](/img/profile.png){: .center-image}

<br/>

My name is Sebastian Sch√∂ner and this is my rarely updated website. I currently live in Stockholm, Sweden.
I'm currently independent. Send me an e-mail (see page footer) if you would like to talk business or have another good reason to.

I dabble in all kinds of things, including but not limited to

- (theoretical) computer science,
- machine learning,
- game programming,
- generative art,
- user experience and design,
- and mathematics.

<br/>

I try to maintain a regular blog, but by the time you read this it will probably not be obvious anymore for what kind of regularity I was originally shooting.

On a more personal note, I am a terrible guitar player (with ambitions on the keyboard and bass guitar), enjoy programming, and listen to music that doesn't take itself too serious. If you want to do me a favor, go visit [Chantal Horeis](https://www.chantalhoreis.com) :)
