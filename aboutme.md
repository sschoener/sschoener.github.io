![A picture of me. You are missing out.](/img/face_small.jpg){: .center-image}

My name is Sebastian Sch√∂ner and this is my rarely updated website. I'm currently working for Paradox Development Studios, working on tools for the Clausewitz Engine.
I dabble in all kinds of things, including but not limited to

 * (theoretical) computer science,
 * machine learning,
 * game programming,
 * generative art,
 * and mathematics.

I am especially interested in 
 * teaching mathematics and computer science,
 * teamwork and leadership,
 * GPGPU programming,
 * cache-friendly programming, high performance, optimization, x86/x64 assembly,
 * clean API and software design,
 * learning new programming languages,
 * Stone Duality for formal languages,
 * and incremental games,
 
in no particular order.

I try to maintain a regular blog, but by the time you read this it will probably not be obvious anymore for what kind of regularity I was originally shooting. See there for other things I might be interested in.

On a more personal note, I am a terrible guitar player (with ambitions on the keyboard and bass guitar), enjoy programming, and spend way too much time listening to Mandowar (sic!). If you want to do me a favor, go visit [Chantal Horeis](https://www.chantalhoreis.com) :)

Feel free to send me an e-mail (see page footer) if you have a good reason to do so.
