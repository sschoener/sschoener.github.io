*Gravvity* is a generative art project I created in the Summer of 2010. The main idea was to create a tool that allows the user to create art collaboratively with a program. The actual result is a particle system in which the path of each particle in a gravitational field is traced over time, while the user is always able to clear the canvas, change the parameters of the simulation, and perform other shenanigans.
