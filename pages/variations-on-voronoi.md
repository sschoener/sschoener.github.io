*Variations on Voronoi* is a procedural art project I created in the Summer of 2016. It uses variations on a very simple algorithm to compute discrete Voronoi diagrams in screen space to generate marvelous, detailed pictures. [They also look great when printed out!]({% post_url 2017-12-24-prints %}) :)
