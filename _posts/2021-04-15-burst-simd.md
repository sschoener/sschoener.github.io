title: Burst SIMD Exercises
excerpt: 
tags: [programming]

A year ago I created a bunch of exercises for SIMD programming for an internal HackDay at Unity that I organized. I've now decided to make that generally available [here](https://github.com/sschoener/burst-simd-exercises) on GitHub. The SIMD exercises make use of Burst's SIMD intrinsics. If you know Unity, this is probably the nicest SIMD programming environment around. Give it a shot, if you want to :)
