Quite often, I see this:
> Forget it, I'm stupid, this is all wrong.

or 
> Sorry, I broke it, it was a stupid and unnecessary mistake.

While some mistakes are actually unnecessary and completely avoidable, I do not mind stupid mistakes. They are in a way the best form of mistake: you did something, quickly realized it was wrong, and now you are already in your way to fix it. That's fantastic: you made a mistake, you acknowledged it (mostly to yourself!), you saw what was wrong, and then you learned from it.

Compare this to making "not-stupid" mistakes: Maybe it took years to realize you were wrong. Or you had to spend the last 2 weeks debugging what _specifically_ went wrong in that one edge-case. That's the actually expensive stuff. Maybe you just realized how much work you have to throw away now. Now imagine you had not made hundreds of ~~stupid~~ practice mistakes before: How would you have learned to forgive yourself for your mistakes? How would you have practiced to own your mistakes and learn from them?

Next time when you make a stupid mistake, just be grateful that it was really just a stupid mistake, and not a colossal, expensive screw-up. They'll come eventually, and this was just a practice round.
