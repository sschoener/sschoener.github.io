I finally got around to making prints of some procedurally generated images that I created in 2016 (!). Take a look:

![Print 1](/img/2017-12-24-prints/print1.jpg){: .center-image}

![Print 2](/img/2017-12-24-prints/print2.jpg){: .center-image}

![Print 3](/img/2017-12-24-prints/print3.jpg){: .center-image}

The program that brought these pictures into being is written in Java using Processing, a faboulus library for everything related to procedural art. Each picture is only 500px squared in size -- the reason for this is that the images are generated pixel-by-pixel and all the gradients you can see are actually produced via dithering. There are plenty of fine-grained details to be found; you can get an idea of that by taking a close look at the second picture, there is a very fine grid spanning over the whole image. These three pictures are actually all small crops from a much bigger image, and I'd like to believe that it is clearly visible that they belong together.

Originally, I printed 4 series, but it turns out that even with a high DPI printer it can be pretty hard to get the colors to come out nicely *for each single pixel*. But I am very happy with how this one turned out :)
