title: You don't have an IC career path

If you want to know whether the company you work at has functioning career paths for individual contributors (ICs, as compared to managers), look at whether anyone has walked that path. If no-one ever gets promoted to the highest IC levels and it is instead just where VPs go when they need a change of scenery, then your company does not, in fact, have a career path for ICs.
