So I was trying learn more about CMake and got slightly annoyed by the lack of decent learning resources. Yes, in some cases it's actually quite simple, but why does it take ages to figure out what to do when you simply want to compile a C library with a few tests without importing some giant library or writing 50+ lines of CMake directives that you simply don't understand.
To add to that pile of useless learning resources, I have set up [a repository](https://github.com/sschoener/cmake-example-project) with heavily documented CMake-files that cover this use case. It is by no means complete (it is missing the installation part of deploying software) which is mostly a consequence of me trying not to talk about anything I don't really understand yet. I hope you find it helpful.
