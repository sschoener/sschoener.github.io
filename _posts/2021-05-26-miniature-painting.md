title: An Excursion into Miniature Painting
excerpt:

---

15 years ago, I picked up some miniatures from the then new Lord of the Rings miniature game. I was really in love with the dioramas you can recreate with hundreds of these miniatures but quickly lost interest once I realized that I am completely out of my depth when it comes to painting these miniatures. I still vividly remember trying to apply some of the various common painting techniques (dry brushing, for example) without success and getting more demotivated by the day. My biggest problem in retrospect was using _way_ too much paint, not thinning it at all.

One way or another, I started to look into miniatures again a few weeks ago - maybe to establish a hobby away from my computer that I can more easily work on while overlooking an infant in the living room ;) These 15 years made all the difference: Of course there is a vibrant community of miniature painters on YouTube now. Back then, at 13 years old living in a remote village, there was no-one to reach out to. Maybe I also just got better at following instructions.

Anyway! I picked up a Necron painting starter kit and followed Dana Howl's excellent [Hobby Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgjZmJo29os) series. In this post I want to show and critique the results and the process.

### The raw models
I bought a package containing 3 Necron warriors from Warhammer 40k, 9th edition, plus some colors. As a bit of commentary on this box: Wow did Games Workshop miss the mark here. It is obviously aimed at beginners, yet it comes without any painting instructions (like "Hey, maybe thin your colors!"). There's a comment there that you should look at their Citadel Color's app to get help though that particular figure is hard to find in the app and there is no painting scheme that corresponds to the colors in the box.

For a hobby that is already challenging to get in, I'm amazed how bad of a job this particular box is at getting anyone into it.

Here are the models I am painting:
