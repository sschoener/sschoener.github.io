title: What Is Design?

I have been pondering the meaning of the term _design_ since I am currently spending a lot of time reading and learning more about UX design. But what does _design_ mean?

_Design_ comes up in many contexts:
 * visual _design_,
 * UI _design_,
 * API _design_,
 * product _design_,
 * UX _design_,
 * audio _design_,
 * web _design_,
 * etc.

People usually think about _visual design_ when they hear _design_, but to me the most common usage is in the design of software, design of programming languages, or the design of an API. None of that is about aesthetics or looks. In fact, the broad sense in which we are using the term makes it pretty clear to me that design is a methodology, not a field of work.

## A design is a conscious choice
Design is
 * making conscious choices,[^root]
 * being aware of the context in which your work is happening,
 * knowing what problem you are solving,
 * knowing what constraints you have, and
 * choosing the trade-offs you need to make.

A designer is someone who asks
 * why you are building something,
 * what problem you think you are solving,
 * what the thing you are building is for,
 * how it will be used,
 * by whom it will be used,
 * in what circumstances it will be used,
 * whether it will be used,
 * what its purpose is,
 * what choices there are in creating it, and
 * what trade-offs are involved with each choice.

Design is about making _deliberate, conscious choices_.
